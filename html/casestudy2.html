However, in our research, we discovered that people struggle to find information on the current layout which is causing users to abandon the site.

                        <p>Recommend removing this bar. This navigation bar is not noticeable because of its placement, color, and size. It is at the top of the screen which indicates some importance but it is made much smaller and duller in color which makes people scan right past it. The “skip to main content” button is unnecessary as it only scrolls the user down slightly. “About us” could be combined into the primary nav bar. “Contact Us” could be added to the footer of the page as this is a common placement for this information. “FAQs'' could be broken up into sections that it pertains to. “Language Assistance '' should be given a larger placement elsewhere to increase discoverability.</p>
                        <h4>2. Utility search bar navigation </h4>
                        <p>The search bar is easy to locate because of its size and placement which ranks it high in the hierarchy of the page. However, the search bar does not consistently give helpful results and may not be the navigation tool that needs the most emphasis. Recommend making it smaller to allow it to be a secondary navigation tool.</p>

                      <p>This navigation bar has a good placement near the top of the page and is noticeable to users right away. It includes the most useful categories for users. Category organization seems logical for this information. Recommend building a drop-down menu into this menu to allow users quicker access to the specific content they need.</p>
                      <h4>4. The second primary navigation bar</h4>
                      <p>This tool is a repeat of the primary navigation bar just including pictures and a brief explanation. It includes the most useful categories on the site. The second navigation bar is by far the most notable section on the homepage. However, it a repeat of the primary bar which could be confusing to some users. Recommend just one primary nav bar to free up space and reduce confusion.</p>
                      <h4>5. Local navigation side menu</h4>
                      <p>This is on the center-right of the homepage. Its purpose is to help a user navigate quickly to specific forms or links without traveling through the different header categories. It likely provides quick links to commonly searched for items, but it does not appear to have any organization to it so users will likely only use it when they stumble onto it by accident. Recommend integrating links into logical categories to make them useful. </p>
                      <h4>6. Footer</h4>
                      <p> Here we have the same actions as the Primary and Secondary navigation bars. However, this one has secondary titles and direct links. This seems unnecessary and redundant. Users may be confused by the same links appearing on the page multiple times. Recommend integrating most links into primary nav to reduce clutter. Recommend keeping social media links as this is where people usually look for them. Card sorting will help assess where links should be located.</p>
