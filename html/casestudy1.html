                    <p>We targeted people who were totally unfamiliar with aikido, but who participated in other organized movement practices such as yoga studios, cycling classes, etc, because they were likely candidates for attending an aikido class and they were expereinced with the process of having to search online for a new place. In addition, we interviewed someone who was a new member to the dojo to learn their thought process in actually joining Nashville Aikikai.</p>

                    <p>We asked several questions to assess the priorities of our users when selecting a place to train. Then we had the users get on the Nashville Aikikai website and complete a few tasks to assess what was important in helping them make a decision to attend a class and what caused frustration or confusion.</p>

                <p>To pinpoint and define our problem statement and bring focus into what we would be solving, the team collaboratively shared a Google Doc where we gave ourselves 10 minutes to type out several iterations of problem statements. <br>
                Then we quietly read each others and highlighted portions of the wording we liked. <br>
                Finally, we started talking out what portions worked best and combined a few pieces into several more iterations of the statement and agreed on our final draft. </p>

        <p>The Nashville Aikikai website was designed to inform the community about their practice. We have observed that the website isn’t providing the right information for potential students, which may contribute to low attendance in beginner classes. <br>

        <p>We had many great ideas but we needed to keep in mind timeline, scope and practicality of ideas before selecting items to focus on. We used a feature prioritization matrix as a tool to talk out what ideas we liked, what was feasible and what was worth pursuing.</p>
        <img class="caseStudyImg" src="../images/cs1_userflow.png">
        <p>We knew that the organization of information was a painpoint to users on the website and that we needed to do cardsorting to analyze and assess where info lived on the site so a quick user flow was made to keep the team focused on our priority of a new prospective member visiting the website. </p>

            <h3>For Stakeholders</h3>
            <p>We designed the registration page with stakeholders in mind. Registering keeps users invested in showing up to their first class and results in better attendance.<br><br>
            We kept the designs simple enough that it could easily be built with Wordpress or Squarespace or another tool. <br><br>
            We made the site fresh and kept true to the dojo’s philosophies, aesthetics, and how they wanted to be viewed online.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="yellowBack conclusion">
            <h3>For Users</h3>
            <p>We realized users had tons of questions that were keeping them from taking a risk and attending their first class. Because of my intimate knowledge of aikido I was able to write a FAQ section and a “What To Know Before Your First Class” section.<br><br>
            Users wanted a clear vision of what this dojo was like before showing up to class, so careful consideration was given to which photos would appear on the website to paint a better picture to users. We also included testimonals and video.<br><br>
            We made it easier to ask questions if there were things we didn’t cover in the FAQ by including the question form on the website.<br><br>
            We kept the most essential information users looked for up front and central. When is class? and How much is it?
            </p>
        </div>
        <h2>Next Steps:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Additional users testing is suggested to confirm the changes to the navigation. </li><br>
            <li>Assess whether the dojo wants to continue with Wordpress to build the new website. Compare prices and ease of use of other services like Squarespace.</li><br>
            <li>Build out other class pages to fit the structure of the Beginner’s Course page.</li><br>
            <li>Recommend connecting a dojo email to the website to receive questions, and setup a MailChimp to send an automatic confirmation email to newly registered students. </li><br>
            <li>Recommend looking into payment options for users when they register for class such as Stripe to allow for card transactions.</li><br>
            <li>After the initial rollout of the new site, the next user to consider are current existing dojo members.</li><br>
